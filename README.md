These are our primary goals.
Define proper KPIs
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

Retention Manager here at PhoneNow. Before you start working on our dashboard, let me provide you with some inputs
 • Customers who left within the last month
 • Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech 
support, and streaming TV and movies
 • Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges 
and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
 • Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
